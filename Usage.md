Following steps describe the typical plug-in usage:
  * Open an XML file in (any) text editor within your eclipse IDE
  * Provide XPath query you want to execute in the combo box
  * Optionally, you can define several namespaces used in your XPath query in the table on the right side of the view by providing namespace prefix and its URI or click on 'Load all namespaces from current file' to automatically load all the namespaces
  * Execute the query either by pressing 'Enter' (while the cursor is still in the XPath query input box) or by clicking on 'Run query' button
  * The result will be shown under the query combo box
